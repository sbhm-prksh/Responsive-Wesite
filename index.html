                In primitive cultures, education predominantly occurred informally, with little distinction between
                educational activities and other daily endeavors. Instead, the entire environment served as a classroom,
                and adults commonly assumed the role of educators. However, informal education often proves insufficient
                for imparting large quantities of knowledge. To address this limitation, formal educational settings and
                trained instructors are typically necessary. This necessity contributed to the increasing significance
                of formal education throughout history. Over time, formal education led to a shift towards more abstract
                learning experiences and topics, distancing itself from daily life. There was a greater emphasis on
                understanding general principles and concepts rather than simply observing and imitating specific
                behaviors.

                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms.
                Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a
                curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal
                schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences.
                Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education,
                primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching
                methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science
                education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the
                mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational
                phenomena.

                The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education
                and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These
                disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially,
                education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with
                the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth
                and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in
                education. For instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school
                classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements. International organizations, such as UNESCO, have
                been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
